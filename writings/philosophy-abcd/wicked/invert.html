                <br>
                <span class="dgn">what is the opposite of the problem or solution?</span><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure I understand, wouldn't the opposite of the problem be the solution, and vice versa? Also, this seems like it would be extremely difficult. In order to know the opposite of something, I would have to know what that thing is, and if I don't know the solution to my problem, I can't know what the opposite of the solution is.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, actually perhaps that's the point; the idea being if you can come up with an opposite you can then use that to come up with a solution.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="dgn">what would be the worst idea?</span><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give everyone a massive amount of addictive drugs while continuing to criminalize them. That would make more people struggle but keep the social isolation people would feel by struggling.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok but I don't know that's the case, I believe it to be true but it's possible that this wouldn't be the worst idea. What does worst even mean? <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm starting to kind of be sick of this issue. I should have chosen something lighter, like running out of lighter fuel. That's an easy problem to solve - just turn on the light and grab the fuel from there.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="dgn">who isn't the target audience?</span><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who already do not have problems with drugs would not be the target audience of attempting to fix drug abuse. Perhaps this is flawed, after all, everyone's behavior has an impact on other people's behavior.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure what to do with this though, so into the idea bin it goes.
