                <b>Amplifying the problem</b><br>
                what if everyone struggled with drug abuse?<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to be honest, I don't know. Perhaps it wouldn't be called drug abuse; many people drink alcohol regularly and that's not called a problem, but if someone takes heroin once it's very much a problem.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's not really a good example though. Alcoholics do exist, just because alcohol is legal doesn't mean they don't happen. And people talk about screen addiction, or addiction to whatever, so amplifying the problem would probably still cause the same level of friction.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to think of it, I can't really think of anything that is a bit negative that people don't already have problems with. Lots of people complain about others playing too many video games, driving cars too much, people even used to complain about reading too much.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correction: nobody really complains about reading too much? But that's more of a situational thing. This is a tangent. <br>
                What would happen if everyone was addicted to drugs? Life expentancies would be lower, probably. More medical resources would be put into helping people who were dependent on drugs.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that wouldn't make sense, if everyone was permanently on drugs why would you even try to cure them? How did everyone get dependent in the first place? I'm not sure if this has helped.
