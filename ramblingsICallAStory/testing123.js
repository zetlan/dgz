var chapters_1 = `Josh grumbles at nothing in particular as our spacecraft flies through the void. He's always frustrated at something, whether it's me, the other members of the team (Cynthia and Rob), or the world in general. Finally he says something. "Why are we on this stupid ship?". I sigh. We've been over this a million times, and yet he still insists on attempting to drag us back down to the planet. "I told you", I respond, "We weren't happy on the planet. Leaving was the only way to survive." "Well, maybe you all should have just smiled and dealt with it! Maybe, Bobby, instead of coming up with smart retorts, you should take inspiration from Teardrop!"<br>
<br>
So we sit in silence as the craft ascends further away from the planet's surface, and eventually turns parallel to it. The craft is relatively spacious, with living quarters for all of us connected to a central room where we can chat or just stare out the high quality windows. I think they're some sort of specialized glass, because they've never cracked or broken, although I always worry that they might. I don't completely understand the furniture on the ship. I've never counted it, but there always seems to be just quite not enough furniture to go around. As a result, Rob is sitting on the floor. He reminds us to drink water, and I remind him that we left all our water on the planet.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that was not a good idea.<br>
<br>
I'm still thinking when Josh cuts in again. "We should have at least brought water on this stupid trip. Seriously, we could have just stayed on the planet. Cynthia's the only one dragging us up here." As if on cue, Cynthia walks in. "Hi," she says, like someone who doesn't know how to speak. I certainly don't know how to speak either.<br>
<br>
Josh leaves. Rob is still sitting on the floor, even though there are now enough chairs for all three of us to sit in, most likely because`;




var chapters_2 = `How can a NOT gate do its work? For when the power is on, it is easy to simply divert the flow of power. Shutting down a communications line takes no more than the press of a button, and anyone who has witnessed a lightning strike first hand knows that electricity is more than capable of destroying the results of itself. The laws of thermodynamics state that in a closed system, entropy must eventually increase. Entropy, being the lack of information in a system. When a cup of coffee is uniformly distributed, the horrible liquid in perfect harmony with itself, there is only one way to describe the coffee. Writers may disagree, but writers are stupid. <br><br>
I conducted a survey yesterday, in which I went around to all my friends asking about the status of writers. Horribly underpaid, in my opinion, however all of my compatriots aquiesced among themselves that writers are in fact at the very lower end of the hierarchy of respectable jobs! After all, no writers have ever remained friends with over two people. This is why the conversities we had were extremely brief.  <br><br>
Returning to the initial concept at hand, entropy must always increase. In the perfectly balanced cup of coffee, when a human drinks it, they are drinking pure coffee. And the disappointment of the taste is pure as well. However. When one produces from within the premises of their own saline kitchen, a frothy cappuccino, well then the possibilities are endless! Cappucinos not only taste a thousand times more invigorating than plain coffee, but there are ingredianents mixed in as well! The foam, swirling like ten thousand tiny galaxies, dances across the surface of the liquid. The amount of information contained in a single cup of cappuccino is immeasurable. <br><br>
Now. Is this to condemn the likes of the coffee in favor of drinking hot chocolate, where marshmallows melt and change state, a chaotic undercurrent is contained within the container? Or Cappuccino, where the taste is pleasing to the tongue and the soul of a little girl? Partially yes. However. It is more. <br><br>
When a NOT gate receives no power, it faces a dilemma. For how is one to produce from a state of nothing? NOT gates receive one input, and one input alone. They send one output, and one output alone. How can one induce a current when one receives no current? For producing energy would break the very laws of thermodynamics that appear to govern our universe? Why then, must we be subject to the ever-changing cost of a kilowatt, when a NOT gate could produce current all on it's own? It's baffling, the will of the people silenced by a single gate, so tiny it could fit under someone's fingernail. And yet, here we are. At a crossroads, with one side having eternal bliss, and one side containing only suffering. Hell hath its layers like an onion, says Dante, but in reality, hell is the simple NOT gate, generating its power when none is supplied to it. <br><br>
Why must we separate our gates into binaries? Why must a NOT gate return a 1 when it is given a 0? Did we ever stop to consider the impacts that we may be having on the world, and by extension, the NOT gate? Of course not. it would be silly. However.<br><br>  
<br>
However. <br>
<br>
It has been nine hours and forty-five minutes since the last time I spoke to a NOT gate. They were a nice fellow, although technically, if you look closely, they are more complicated than just outputting a 1 when given a 0. The life of the NOT gate is a complex process, fully open to the whims of the electrons whizzing past on an ionizing wind. If you get to know them better, their lives become much more complex, and I am glad I could learn from them.<br>
<br>
I must go. The cappuccino calls.`;





var chapters_3 = `<img src="image/pathUnknown123abc123abc123abc.png" alt="ERROR:images/pathUnknown/123abc123abc123abc.png/file_not_found"> The table wasteland is a most interesting location on the planet. Nobody really remembers how it came to be, but it is certainly a place that exists now, and few can live there. Legend has it that somewhere near the center of the table wasteland, an old carpenter sits, creating tables. However, others say that this is nonsense. <br>
<br>
The table wasteland is 47 miles in radius, and is located at approximately 45Â° above the equator. Why. The concept of assigning points to different geometries has always eluded me. On a euclidean plane, it is easy. One can assign each point to 2 numbers, one for the x axis, and one for the y axis. One can then use this system to assign coordinates, and they work when added, subtracted, multiplied, or otherwise operated on in most ways. <br>
<br>
On a spherical geometry, the process is similar. For when attempting to map the location of the table wasteland, it is easy to assign those 2 numbers not to points, but instead to angles, spun around perpendicular axes. Only 2 angles can describe any point on the surface of a sphere, and the concept is relatively easy to imagine in the world we live in. After all, humanity live on the surface of a sphere, so most of them are used to the concept.<br>
<br>
However, how can one assign a coordinate system to a hyperbolic plane? Lines curve. Trying to map the surface with squares and then projecting it down to a surface that is easily understandable fails when the coordinate system is ill-defined. I want to assign parallels, but there are too many parallel lines to choose just one. Traveling 180 degrees only sometimes lands a body where it started, and straight lines become arcs of a great circle, perpendicular to infinity. A hyperbolic world is a terrifying one, and this is the where the table wasteland lies. Too many tables are squished onto this tiny speck. More and more tables appear closer to the edges, until the great mass piles up, extruding into dimensions previously unknown. The carpenter has nary the time to fill the space around him<br>
<br>
<br>
the table wasteland has a climate mostly defined by its ever present clouds and blustering wind. The wind always carries the clouds away from the area before they rain, meaning that although the average temperature is not particularly hot, the air is also extremely dry. Fires are occasionally an issue. The last fire was 273 years ago, and burned through 73% of the wasteland before it extinguished itself. It is unknown how the carpenter has maintained their own health through the centuries.<br> `;




var chapters_4 = `Cynthia walks over to me from the chair she is sitting in. "Well, what is there left to say?" She queries. I sigh, unsure of how to articulate my thoughts.<br>
<br>
"I mean yes, I suppose we did work things out between ourselves, but there's still constant tension," I think of how Josh always gets in the way of a productive discussion, how Rob is unhelpful. Us two are really the only ones trying to push forwards, and that's kind of scary. "What if we don't survive?" I ask back. There's the constant threat of extinction, from space or from the many worlds around us.<br>
<br>
Bobby is stubborn. That's one of his many character flaws. "Well, then that's too bad for us I guess. But it's no reason not to try." He scowls at me. I don't understand why he can't just accept us and pilot the gosh darn ship. It's always like this. I know he's not trying to hold us back, but every day counts in the constantly changing universe. "That's scary though, this is our entire universe we're talking about. We can't just accept a universe without us in it."<br>
<br>
I think about the proposition. "Yes we can. And anyways, it's not like the universe can really just snuff us out as easily as that."<br>
<br>
I am confused. Cynthia's saying a lot of things that don't make sense. Of course the universe can just snuff us out, like the lives of so many of our compatriots. I voice these concerns, and she laughs. "None of those were really the universe's fault. It was all internal conflicts that eventually lead to their... departure." I have an easy counter-argument for that. "Well, won't going through with this plan involve internal conflicts?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, but that's a different type of internal conflict, the type where we learn and grow and become better people." <br>
<br>
We are both unhappy at this discussion.<br>
<br>
I stare out the window at the purple planet below, the occasional patch of orange catching my eye as bits of debris skate across the upper atmosphere. We have been orbiting the planet for quite a long time. It's only been a few weeks, but it feels like forever, since we keep having the same conversations over and over again. Are there other things to talk about? Of course. But for some reason, we keep coming back to this topic. <br>

var chapters_6 = `A metaphor is commonly used by writers to add vibrance and passion to writing, or to make a part easier to understand. For example, how could one describe the creator of the universe without metaphors? They have been described as so many different things, one begins to wonder how we could possibly not describe them. What if instead of using a metaphor properly, one were to take a metaphor and stretch it across the entirety of a body of work, not connecting it to any story at all until the very end? Would that be productive at all? Perhaps, but it would also not make for a very compelling story. After all, if we cannot care about the characters, and they are only metaphors, then what is the purpose of the story? <br>
<br>
24 hour time is better than 12 hour time. Why? Because it's more descriptive and requires fewer characters. I can describe all times of the day with 24 hour time in 5 characters (from 00:00 to 23:59) but with 12 hours, not only are there repeat times, but you have to add an extra three characters to the end. (12:00 to 11:59 AM and 12:00 to 11:59 PM.) Not only that, but the 12s always get confused, and require context around them to really internalize what time it is. If I were to say "I ate lunch at 12:37," the reader would assume that the 12 in question is noon, and not midnight. However, if the sentence was "I ate a snack at 12:37," then the context is simply not enough to determine what time the writer is truly talking about, and therefore the AM or PM must be added to the end.<br>
<br>
Also clocks! Don't get me started on the clocks. All the analog clocks are 12 hour clocks. WHY? Who decided that 12 hour time was the best way to measure the time, as if going around the face 2 times a day instead of 1 isn't enough. Alex over here was has to clean the dishes at 2:00, but because of the 12 hour clocks, they clean them twice a day instead of the required once. How are they supposed to know at what time the dishes should be cleaned? Because the clock sure doesn't! I'm really out here watching people clean the dishes twice a day.<br>`;

<br>
<br>    
What. <br>
<br>
What?<br>
<br>
I am sitting alone in my room, thinking about appearences. To what extent is my appearence my own? I am confused. When I am online, I play a character. There are certain important differences between me and my online persona that make it pertinent to know the differences. For one, the names are different. Clementine is not my real last name. There are many things I do in real life, such as cubing, that I do not express online.<br>
<br>
However, in a sense, do I not also play a character in real life? My desk is a mess, as it always is. My mother keeps saying I should clean it, but I don't really feel like it, because I would probably get distracted and also it's not that exciting to clean a desk off. My mother and her husband are working on the bathroom remodelling, and they are making quite a lot of noise. I've never really liked it when they remodel parts of the house. I'm not really sure why though, perhaps that is another topic for introspection on.<br>
<br>
My point is that there are parts of my life that I don't express when going out into the world. I don't tell strangers/friends my life story, sometimes even if they ask. I sometimes wonder how much of me really exists, or if it's all a combination of characters I have created over the years. For example, I stopped cubing a few months ago, after an... event with one of my friends, who also cubes. My online persona never cubed, and so the event had absolutely no impact. I stopped cubing in real life, meaning the character people see me as stopped cubing as well. However, to a few of my family members, the character of me still cubes, and is still improving, because the version of me that they have is outdated and wrong. <br>
<br>
A lot of these little things are ok, tiny divergences from my true self, but if my true self diverges greatly from the person I am to the people around me, then there starts to be a problem. I start to wonder if maybe there is no true self, just layers of characters performing actions.<br>
<br>
This is not helpful. If I have no true self, then it doesn't make sense that without the influences of society, I enjoy certain things and do not enjoy others.<br>
<br>
My carpet is pretty soft, and the constant whirr of the fans of my laptop is comforting, even though there are other grinding, crashing, and unpleasant sounds that pervade the air in my room. I attempt to not focus on them, in failure. Disappointed, I call up one of my friends to talk to him. "Hey Bobby, how are you?" He responds.<br>

var chapters_9 = `I look out through the window of the ship into the endless void, and receive thousands of tiny specks of light in return. Space is beautiful, it's a type of well-ordered chaos not seen in many places. There's just a type of amazement I feel, when looking out, realizing that the whole vast expanse really has a depth to it, and isn't just a flat projection. When one looks at the sky from a planet, it seems endless, but it's really just a thin line between you and deep space. The space though, goes on forever, as far as we know.<br>
<br>
<br>
I counted the chairs today. There were 7 chairs, one was ornately decorated with circles and mahogany ridges. I had never seen it before, so I'm pretty sure that someone is adding furniture to the central room somehow. Perhaps Josh or Rob is taking the furniture out of their room and moving it to the center room? I haven't really seen their rooms, since I usually spend my time either in this central room, or in my own. There isn't any furniture in my room, just a whiteboard and a really comfortable floor.<br>
<br>
The vibrant blue star comes into our field of view as we pass the dark side of the planet. I am thinking about our situation, and I feel that there isn't really anything to be done about it. I know Josh will probably yell at me later for thinking that, because we "gotta keep moving" in his own words, but really what is there to do? One day it seemed like everything was fine, the next day the world turned upside down and we had to leave the planet. Cynthia would probably know better than me, but she's never divulged the full reason. Ever since we left, the passage of time has seemed so surreal. We orbit the planet approximately once every 125 minutes, meaning that the day and night cycle isn't really a good indicator of how long we've been up here. Don't get me wrong, watching the celestial bodies is still cool and all, but I would really rather be grounded and not have to deal with thinking about everything at once. Sometimes it seems like the hours pass by in a flash, and sometimes it seems like the time drags on and on, without any real progression. <br>
<br>
I want to talk to someone else. I pull myself away from the window and think about who to talk to. Josh is out of the question, because he doesn't like being talked to by anyone else, so that just leaves Rob and Cynthia, both of whom are not great conversation partners. Cynthia also wants to go back home, but before we do we have to officially resolve the issue of not having to leave again and confronting the mob that was outside our fortress, and I'm really not the type of person to do that. So, that just leaves Rob.<br>
<br>
Opening his door he beckons me in and I sit down on one of the chairs in his room. Perhaps that's where the new chairs are coming from. His room is extremely well furnished. There is a bed with blue sheets in the corner farthest from the door, six wooden chairs arranged in a circle around the center of the room, and a dresser. I'm not really sure how many pairs of clothes he has, but he certainly has the most out of all of us. I'm getting distracted. Gosh, so many things on this ship don't make sense. We've been up here for at least 3 weeks and you mean to tell me there's no kitchen on this ship? There's got to be one around here somewhere. "Bobby," Rob brings me back to reality. "Yeah?" I reply, still thinking about the lack of a kitchen. "You should drink some water." Well I know that, but we really are sort of in a shortage of glasses due to the lack of a kitchen.<br>
<br>
I cannot believe this. How did this happen? We built this ship. We should know where the kitchen is, but is there really no kitchen? I don't remember seeing one in the blueprints, but then again, there were only 3 rooms in the blueprints, but we have 5. How did we build a spaceship without proper blueprints for the spaceship? I have not eaten in months, and to be honest I feel fine, but I would really like a good watermelon. Unfortunately, there are no watermelons on this ship, since there is no kitchen.<br>
<br>
Have you ever had a watermelon? Some people tell me that they just taste like crunchy water, but I disagree. They are extremely watery, (90% water, as Cynthia helpfully told me) but they're also sweet and they can be cut into triangles, then eaten in those triangles. Similar to pizza, but sweet instead of savory.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am preparing a watermelon in the kitchen. Josh says that watermelons are disgusting and just taste like crunchy water, but I disagree. I enjoy cutting up my watermelon into squares, and then eating the squares off a plate. It makes me feel fancy, like I am a fine british child at a british table. Unfortunately, britain probably would not be receptive if we landed there, due to its nonexistence at the moment. I pop a square of watermelon into my mouth. The others probably haven't found the kitchen yet, because they've all been occupied with their own tasks, but I have had time to explore. Unlike some people here, I am happy with myself.<br>

var chapters_10 = `Macaroni and cheese is a strange dish, one that I do not have often on the principle that macaroni and cheese really does not taste that good. It is a passable meal, but the kind that one can buy from the store is not of the best quality. When I refer to macaroni in cheese, I am generally talking about the store bought kind, and not the kind made by people for special occasions or just to consume. Why do I need to make this distinction? Mainly, because the amount of quality taste in each type of macaroni is worlds different. <br>
<br>
Store bought macaroni is generally a bit bland, the noodles are extremely small, and the cheese is fake cheese dust sprinkled on top of the dish as it is being cooked. This kind is edible, but I would not go out of my way to eat it. Home made macaroni and cheese on the other hand, is a bit more difficult to describe. Everybody has their own way of making it. Sometimes breadcrumbs are added, sometimes multiple types of cheese are layered on top of one another. The noodle size varies greatly. Because of this, the consumption of home made mac-C (what the cool kids call macaroni and cheese) is generally much more interesting and pleasurable to the taste buds.<br>
<br>
Because of the clear superiority of home-made mac-C, one may wonder why store mac-C continues to exist. It may be a sign of the times then, that one day my family and I arrived home after a journey across society, only to find a box of uncooked store bough mac-C strewn across the lower part of our driveway. It was a strange event, as this was at approximately 21:00, meaning that it was dark outside. I took a few pictures, but due to the unfortunate size and shape of the noodles, it just looks like a rather large collection of worms on the asphalt.<br>

The Box was completely intact.<br>
The packet of fake cheese was completely intact.<br>
All of the macaronis were intact. The only odd thing about the box of mac-C was that it was on our driveway, and that it had somehow managed to spill without anybody noticing it.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am still trying to imagine the circumstances that could have lead to the creation of this event. I am relatively sure that it was not us, running over a stray box of mac-C on the way into the car space, because if such a collision had occurred, the box would be crushed, the contents smeared along a predictable pattern. The box wasn't even in the path that our car took from the road to our garage.<br>
<br>
I can therefore only come to the conclusion that someone must have, in a fit of blind rage, taken an innocent box of mac-C, ripped open the top, and hurled it upon the ground, where the contents spilled out and the perpetrator fled. I do have to wonder what their grudge against a humble box of store mac-C was, but perhaps it was the overwhelming mediocrity of the taste that finally got to them.<br>

var chapters_1b = `So in the end, have we really learned anything from this whole venture? Or is it just another rehashing of the same conversation?

The world is not a meritocracy. That's one of the many lies perpetuated by people who would benefit from you working and not questioning the system. If someone can waltz in here and achieve in 1 month what it took someone else 3 years to do, then I think perhaps talent and skill are a little lackluster of an explanation. What then, are we supposed to do with the pieces of society? 

I say cast them into the sun, and hopefully we'll never have to deal with them again.

I want computer chips to be made better, and I want corporations to not be greedy, and I want a million different things about myself and the world around me. However, I can't have those, because the world is not magical.

And no, those are not my thoughts, those are the thoughts of !!!Um!! A fictional character! Named *spins wheel* Amy! (who let the girl names on the spinner? Jeff? Was it you?


Yes Jeff. You're fired. I told you boy names only, but you didn't listen. 

*sigh* anyways, what was I saying?

Amy's kind of a good name, not going to lie. What are some of the others? Lily? Hmm..`;

<br>
The atmosphere is extremely thin, roughly 0.04 ATM at sea level, and contains mostly carbon dioxide with some trace amounts of hydrogen. No plant life exists, and the soil is powdery. Clouds form regularly, although it is unknown what they are made of, as the atmosphere is theoretically too thin to support them. The seas have a pH of 1.342, and as such are extremely unsafe for human life.<br>
<br>
Two known colonies have been to Tenalp. The first one is the british colonies, arriving close to timestep 136871932, and then splitting into two colonies due to disagreements. As of timestep 137144490, only the colony farthest from the equator remains.<br>
<br>
<br>
Climate varies greatly due to the lack of atmosphere. Near the equator, temperatures can range from 10Â° to -100Â°. This is due to the large thermal mass of the oceans, which reduces temperature range, and a continual warming force from the inside of the planet.<br>
<br>
Closer to the poles, the temperature is slightly colder, with a range of -10Â° to -130Â°. Both poles are covered by the ocean, but no freezing has been seen to occur.<br>
<br>
The second colony is of unknown origin, and appears to be very expansionist, covering a radius of 47 miles as of timestep 137144590. It is located approximately halfway from the equator to the north pole.</p>`;




var chapters_12 = `Josh scowls at me across the kitchen. I am eating a slice of watermelon, cut into a triangle, because I think that's the best shape to eat watermelon in. Alas, I have more things to worry about than just the status of my watermelon slice. I glance over at him. "Yes?" I venture. "I don't think Cynthia is really part of the team," he responds.<br>
<br>
Well. That's a new one.<br>
<br>
"Where did you get that idea?"<br>
<br>
"Think about it," he continues. "She just showed up here about a month ago, just unannounced, walked right in through the front door or something. Nobody does that! But here she is. She's also the only girl. Why are we letting girls in here now?"<br>
<br>
I sigh. I'm not even really sure where to start with this. "Well for one, she's here, on the spaceship, which means she's a part of team, no matter how she got here. Also, I'm pretty sure her gender is irrelevant to how seriously she should be taken." <br>
<br>
Josh is still unhappy with that. "Okay but she's probably not even a real person. It's probably just Rob playing a trick on us or something. I mean, when's the last time someone new showed up?" I think back, and the answer is I don't know. I've known Josh and Rob for as long as I can remember, so I guess he does have a point there. Perhaps the question is phrased wrong though, I know it's wrong. I think about it some more.<br>
<br>
"Maybe she isn't a new person? Maybe she's always been here, and we just didn't notice? I mean, I didn't notice this kitchen until Cynthia pointed it out last week."<br>
<br>
"No, that's stupid. We would have noticed her." Josh responds. "And she's caused nothing but problems since she arrived. First the angry mob, then the whole gOiNg tO SpACe thing, seriously, what's that about? Are we just expected to go along with this? I'm trying to get our lives back, and everybody here is just crazy!"<br>
<br>
He seems to be getting more frustrated, and I'm also tired of arguing with him, so I quietly finish my watermelon and leave. Fine. At least the kitchen is cool. We have a dishwasher, a sink, a fridge, where the watermelon is stored, and a freezer, because Rob loves his ice cubes. Josh has been refusing to eat anything, on the principle that anything found by Cynthia is dangerous. Whatever.<br>
<br>
I take my leave of the kitchen through the one entrance there is to it, and realize I don't completely know how to get back to the main room on my own. There's a bit of a series of twisting passageways between the common room and the kitchen, and I've never actually memorized the way back.<br>
<br>
"Hmm..." I muse as I reach the first fork in the tunnel. You would think that this ship would have been designed better, given that it was designed by us, but there are`;







var chapters_13 = `I rush up the stairs of the fortress as the screams echo from below. Panting, I burst into Rob's room. "Oh, hey," Rob says, upon seeing me. Gasping for breath, I close the door behind me and collapse into a chair.<br>
<br>
"Yeah,... what the HECK? Why are there demons?" I exclaim. Rob does not seem phased at all by this. "Oh yeah, those. We knew this would happen eventually. All we can do is run from them and put up these signs." He gestures to a pile of cat pictures he has by his bedside table. Looking around the room, I notice that the walls are plastered with many, many cat pictures. Rob has prepared.<br>
<br>
I am still confused. "This still makes no sense. Why... are there demons? Can't we just... tell them to go away?" Rob sighs. "You can try, but they won't respond. You'll just get screamed at. The only thing we can really do is put up the cat pictures and run if we need to. By the way, drink water. That may help." Rob slides a glass of water over to me from his position at the table.<br>
<br>
I don't understand Rob. He always seems to be busy with something, whether it's solving puzzles, drawing, working on math, which I can't stand, or reminding everyone to drink water. Rob has a strange way of sitting in his chair as well, he sits a bit like a frog. I always thought his back would hurt, but he doesn't seem to mind. "Why are you so calm about this?" I ask. "Bobby, I've known this was coming for a while. Nobody else listened to me, even when the first one showed up a few years ago. To be honest, I hoped you would listen, because Josh is the only other one, and of course he wouldn't listen." Right. I know Josh, and he doesn't like Rob. Rob is too cringey for him apparently. He is right, there was an increase in tension and screams a few years ago, but I didn't really pay attention to it because I was busy trying to manage contacts outside of the fortress. Josh is... Josh... after all.<br>
<br>
"Well, I'm sorry for not listening to you?" I venture. Rob waves me away. "I have work to do. Try not to let them get to you." I slowly walk out of the room, and brave the increase in screams from below.`;





var chapters_14 = `I am running through the twisting mess of corridors the ship has laid out for me. I can hear them behind me, which I must run. I take a left, a right, another left, perhaps double back and loop around?<br>
<br>
Dance dance, how long can we do the devil dance?<br>
<br>
I am exhausted, but this is how I run. As fast as I can go, eventually I'll escape. Two more lefts, then a right, darn it. A dead end. That costs me time.<br>
<br>
I can hear them closing in, but I can't give up. I've ran before, and I can do it again. Backtracking, I take a left this time, then two rights. I burst into the common room panting, but free. <br>
<br>
"Huh. You look tired." Josh remarks. I glare at him, and retreat to my room.`;


var chapters_15 = `I am staring out one of the many windows at the planet, thinking. I do sometimes wonder what I am trying to accomplish up here. At the very least, Rob doesn't seem to be affected by the change of scenery at all, he's just off in his room all the time, with his pictures of cats. He doesn't really seem to mind me, which is a nice change of pace from Josh, who absolutely hates me, and makes it known.<br>
<br>
I quite enjoy looking at the poles of the planet. Although they aren't much different from the oceans at the equator, the vibrant blue auroras in the upper atmospheres make it great to just watch, and the north pole is always visible from our plane of orbit, so it makes a good point of reference. Our star, (Rob tells me it's called Pental 348, but I think that's not a very pretty name) is currently not visible, but it most likely will be in a few minutes.<br>
<br>
I wonder if my goal is to convince everyone else here that I exist. If that's the case, then we should be descending back to the planet right around now, because I already know Josh will never budge, and the others don't really care or have already accepted me. That must mean there's something else I need to accomplish. However, what could it possibly be?<br>
<br>
Bobby suddenly bursts into the common room from the passage to the kitchen. He appears to be quite out of breath. Perhaps he was running the whole way? I will have to ask him about that later. I like Bobby, although sometimes we disagree on things, like the best choice of dressing, or `;
