                Hedonism is the idea that one's goal in life should be to maximize pleasure. It typically gets a bad connotation, because it is associated with laziness and sensual self-indulgence. Does this mean we should throw the whole thing out though? <br>
                <br>
                Minor side note, throughout this section I will be using the term happiness when the correct term would really be pleasure. I'm not going to change it though, because happiness is a simpler word.<br>
                <br>
                The first problem I have with hedonism is the laziness problem. Doesn't it maximize pleasure to never do any work, so you never have to suffer? Some people claim that humans are inherently lazy, and therefore under hedonism society would collapse. I tend to disagree. I think that humans appear lazy when you put them in a building with strict order and hierarchy, and a lack of autonomy for years, and then force them to do work to survive in another building where they most likely will not have a whole lot of choice in what they do.<br>
                If humans are forced to work for 8 hours a day, it is no surprise that they will appear lazy for the other 16 hours. When one has worked for a long time, then everything, even hobbies, start to feel like work, like they're not worth doing. <br>
                One could argue that is the definition of laziness, that people should be able to work and then do other meaningful work that they find fulfilling. However, I disagree. What even is a laziness? Can I eat it as a snack? Can it fit in my hand? <br>
                The point is that it is possible to both be a hedonist and also trade a slight pleasure now for greater pleasure later. The reward of completing a difficult task may be greater than the reward of never having to work for it, and that equation is up to the individual to decide. <br>
                <br>
                My second problem with hedonism is how individualistic it is. I see it much like advertising in a company. When one is running a company in a functioning market, and they want to make more money, they have three options. They can either wait, and hope more people buy their product over time. This is generally not what companies do, because that is very stagnant and unhelpful. The second option is to genuinely improve the product and create a superior product over their competitors. Or, this is the third option, they can advertise. <br>
                Advertising does not make the product better. However, if one can convince people that the product is better, or it'll make one happier, or associate it with something good, then the company can get more people to buy the product without ever changing the actual product. <br>
                This can be seen in internet service providers, computer companies, soft drinks, really pretty much every large company spends an inordinate amount on advertising because people aren't rational. <br>
                <br>
                The same is with hedonism. If youre a hedonist, and you want to live a happy lifestyle, then you can either actually take steps to improve your life, and think about the consequenses of your actions to calculate what would be the optimal solution, or you can just not do any of that. <br>
                Because of the nature of hedonism, stealing something is only wrong if it lowers the amount of happiness, and while getting caught stealing and going to jail certainly lowers the amount of happiness one has, stealing and getting away with it does not. The person who stole gets a free product, after all, which is better than a product one has to pay for. <br>
                In addition, this can be applied to anything. Anything can be justified, from murder to mass exploitation, as long as it brings the individual committing the acts more happiness.<br>
                So the solution seems simple. Instead of maximizing happiness for a single person, one should maximize happiness for all people.<br>
