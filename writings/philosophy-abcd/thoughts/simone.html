                Simone (I'm going to call her Simone because we are good friends) makes a lot of cogent points. For example, she sources differences between men and women to being raised differently, rather than saying that they are biologically different. She effectively counters many misogynist ideas, such as the idea that women like being in their current position in society, or that they couldn't handle liberation.<br>
                <br>
                However, Simone presents some ideas that have issues. For example, when advocating for an androgynous world and better sexual education for women, she claims that <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is useless to try to inhibit curiosity and pleasure in children; this only results in creating repression, obsessions, and neuroses; exalted sentimentality, homosexual fervor, and the platonic passions of adolescent girls along with the whole procession of nonsense and dissipation are far more harmful than a few childish games and actual experiences."<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's claiming here that women's sexual explorations should not be limited, because when they are, it leads to these bad things (repression, obsessions, neuroses), and then follows up by saying that these bad things are expressed in a few ways, one of which is homosexuals. So her argument is that gay people are created when you oppress women. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree with the conclusion of the main argument (that women should have good sexual education), I disagree with the logic used. Putting aside that this would imply gay men don't exist / would be much fewer than gay women (because men are oppressed less than women), it essentially claims that gay people don't actually exist, that they only appear to because being gay is a coping mechanism or bad habit caused by society's oppression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                She also presents only two options for women; reject femininity or embrace it, along with the oppression and lack of agency it entails. I don't like this dichotomy, because it seems kind of harmful to women even in itself. Women must reject femininity if they want to be liberated? Why? Why does feminine have to mean oppressed? Why can't women embrace being feminine while also liberating themselves?
