V1.2 - THE VISUAL UPDATE - ????
    bug fixes:
        tunnels made in the editor no longer reset their music to "Travel The Galaxy" every time you load them
        editing tunnel triggers will no longer crash the level editor (so sorry about this one, that should have been found + fixed waay earlier)

        Fixed animation timing bug when strafing right on some characters
        duplicator duplicates will now no longer be seen through tiles
        Fixed skater + lizard encounters continually showing during their respective cutscenes
        fixed lighting not working when tunnels were far away in cutscenes


    quality-of-life:
        Gameplay:
            adjusted the postion of the G-tunnel
            Nerfed the bunny's speed and strafing a little bit from their uncontrollably fast earlier speed.
            The Lizard is now allowed into part 1 of the memory evaluation tunnel.

        Editor:
            improved cutscene editing camera
                controls are different
                when moving around, but not modifying the camera position, a green indicator shows the position of the true camera.

        misc:
            improved wormhole rendering, especially in corners of the screen
            improved low-precision tunnel rendering
            improved high-precision tunnel rendering


    misc development:
        switched from using .keyCode to .key for inputs, as .keyCode is different for firefox.
            side note: why are keycodes like this? What possible reason could browsers have for using 61 AND 187 for the equals key???? It's a mystery to me.


    TODO YET:
        RENDERING:
            farPolys have issues
            ice ramps  

        BUGS
            With the skater, you can activate angelVBunny even without completing the going home checklist
            weird backwards level issue in N-7
            relativity controls in-editor (make sure exporting works)

        FEATURES
            better line system in editor pull orbs?
            death counter + inf visited counter
            ability to lock editor files
            rotation for tile editing
            characters?





V1.15 - November-16-2021
    bug fixes:
        player is no longer reset to runner after every cutscene
        I accidentally removed the cutscene "Join Us" in the last update! I apologize for the inconvience. It's now back, at the end of A-4.
        In the editor, loading a level will no longer cause the player to temporarily dissapear during playtesting.

    quality-of-life:
        the level editor will now detect if you have old run 3 level data and convert it. This can be in the form of kongregate object data or individual level data from player_03's website.

V1.14 - November-11-2021
    bug fixes:
        entering backwards levels is now more consistient
        exiting out of a cutscene into challenge mode no longer makes the camera wacky
        exiting out of a cutscene no longer allows you to play as locked characters
        there is no longer a phantom child in the cutscene "You Think"

    quality-of-life:
        holding escape for 5 seconds will now trigger a soft reset of the game, hopefully fixing crashes while keeping all data intact
        holding alt while moving the camera in cutscene edit mode will now slowly pan it
        improved audio of Unsafe Speeds and Wormhole to Somewhere
        you now have the option to halve the framerate of gameplay
        tunnels you have walked by but not entered now show up on the map
        Added levels so that A-tunnel now connects to L tunnel, as it should have in the first place

    misc development:
        cutscene coordinates can now be relative to a tunnel. This makes it easier to move tunnels around (no longer have to re-do the entire cutscene)
        improved readability in placing of cutscenes


V1.13 - October-22-2021
fixed issue where framerate would double on 120Hz monitors

V1.1 - FINAL MAIN RELEASE - June-1-2021
