                Plenty of horror stories have been written about governments controlling the intelligence, beauty, or abilities of their population so that everyone may be equal. "Harrison Bergeron", by Kurt Vonnegut is a good example, and so is "Animal Farm" by George Orwell. Although, I suppose, Animal Farm is more about the economy and communism than it is about equality. However, the overall message seems common sense. Not all people are naturally equal, and forcing everyone to be equal is unethical and causes lots of problems. <br>
                Cool. I'm not going to argue that the world of Harrison Bergeron is a good one, it's intentionally designed to be horrifying, and a warning. However, interpretations of it will differ. In the world of Harrison Bergeron, handicaps are put on the citizens of the government to keep them all equal. Harrison is a person who overcomes his handicaps and breaks onto live TV, before being apprehended by the government and taken away, at which point the main character forgets about Harrison due to his mental handicaps. What is this supposed to teach us about? What is the point of it?
                <br>
                One interpretation is that it's about the danger of forcing everyone to be equal. This can be applied to systems such as standardized schooling, where a lot of students are all taught one program, and most students are unhappy because their individuality is removed, and achievement-based systems like prizes and "the world". This also links together with the just world hypothesis, which is that good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people. In short, the world is fine the way it is, and attempts to standardize or make people more equal are bad because they disrupt the natural order of things. <br>
                I have problems with this. For one, it assumes the world is fair, which it's not. The average wealth of a black american in boston is $8 as of 2020. <a href="https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/one-time-pubs/color-of-wealth.aspx">Yes. 7 entire dollars.</a> This is vastly different from the average wealth of a white person in boston, which sits at $247,500. And unless you believe that some races are just better than others, (which is completely false) then the just world hypothesis kind of doesn't work.<br>
                What is to be done about this though? Many people think different things. Some people say "ok, some people have it harder than others, but there are no systemic barriers in place! They should just work harder to get out of poverty!" And. Well. That is certainly an opinion. However, ideally we should work to make sure that poverty is impossible, instead of having people be motivated by the want to not be in poverty. <br>
                <br>
                I think I've gotten a bit off track here. I don't think these books are actually warning against equality. That may seem silly. After all, Harrison Bergeron opens with "THE YEAR WAS 2081, and everybody was finally equal." I don't personally know the author, but if they were really arguing against equality, then why did they bring the government into the story? To me, this seems more like a story against authoritarianism, with the method the government uses to control its people being the promise of equality. <br>
                Another view is that we do not need equality, but instead need equity. Equality being treating everyone the same, while equity is giving everyone the treatment they need. Poor and rich people alike are not permitted to steal, but that's much worse for a poor person than it is for a rich one. That makes sense to me. Some people, because of the circumstances of their birth, will just have to work harder than other people to achieve the same results, and it makes sense that they are compensated for that extra work. <br>
                <br>
                I really don't like Harrison Bergeron. It feels malicious to me, like it's saying the idea of equality is bad, and I have to wonder what the author's purpose is. The real problem in the story, after all, is not the equality, but the oppression caused by the government issuing handicaps. An ideal equal world is not one where everyone is brought down to the same level, but is instead boosted up to the same level as the highest people. <br>
                Equality is one of those difficult subjects that I'm not great at arguing about. <br>
