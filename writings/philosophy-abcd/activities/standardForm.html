                </div>
                While many of the premises are true, and some of the conclusions are valid and sound, the author uses many hyperbolic statements and skips over a lot of basics that would be necessary in convincing someone who disagreed with them. This article seems to be made for people who already mostly, if not completely, agree with the author, and serves as more of a vent post rather than a persuasive writing piece. It's an op-ed. Given the ones I've read in the past, as well as this one, I'm getting the sense that those aren't particularly well written most of the time.
