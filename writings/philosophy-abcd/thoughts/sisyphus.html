                <span class="dgn">1) what is your absurdity?</span><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to TJ, it's terrible and wonderful, it's tons of work but there are some great people here. There are some, in my opinion, terrible people here. It's large, complex, and absurd.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="dgn">2) what is your philosophical suicide?</span><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm still not entirely set on the whole philosophical suicide thing. Philosophical suicide, as I understand it, is outsourcing the pursuit of the meaning of life to another institution, in which case religion fits that definition. However, one of the examples we used in class was watching Netflix for long periods of time, which I don't think does that. Watching Netflix certainly brings you out of the real world, but lots of things do that, and if we define philosophical suicide as anything that brings you out of the real world than everything from video games to dancing to sports, pottery, and even math problems can do that. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camu was an athiest philosopher concerned with religion, so it would make sense that the definition would be the former, but in that case I wouldn't have committed philosophical suicide, because I recognize that "what is the meaning / purpose of life" is an answerless question and I don't attempt to answer it, much less get someone else to answer it. I don't think this is the answer you want me to give. Perhaps we could talk more about this?<br>
                <br>
                <span class="dgn">3) what is your rock? what is your resistance? What brings you happiness?</span><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock is a fool's path forward. Camu is correct, life doesn't get better, you never run out of problems to solve, but the idea that the best resistance is to fully commit to tackling your punishment? That's an idea centrists hold, and I'm not going to be a centrist. If there's a problem I can't solve, I need to figure out why, and at least try. Not turn a blind eye and pretend it's the noble thing to do.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, there are an endless number of problems, but life only improves my solving problems. Pushing the same boulder to the top of a hill and back doesn't solve anything, it simply, past a certain point, looks cool to some people. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at Sisyphus and feel disgusted, both with the gods that placed him there and with the idea that he's so fully accepted his conditions that he's happy. Where is the human spirit? Earlier, he <i>captured Death</i>! And now he's satisfied with pushing the same rock up the same GOSH darn hill forever? For all time? Steadily increasing the entropy of the universe until all that's left is this stupid broken contraption designed out of malice by a group of people who don't understand change?<br>
                Desire for change is part of the human condition. And giving up on that is philosophical suicide. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no material difference between a dead-end job and a rock, the only true difference is that Sisyphus has the illusion of happiness in the rock. It is just as damning to decide that pushing the rock is your purpose as it is to decide that working at a job you hate is your purpose, or to decide that devoting yourself to a religion will give you purpose.<br>

                anyways programming brings me happiness it's a cool activity
