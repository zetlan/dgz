                I agree with a lot of the things Benthem and Mills say. For example, the idea of measuring everything and making decisions based on how you think the total utility of the world will change, that's a pretty cool idea. It's not too rigid, to the point of being silly, and it's logical, as I think most people would agree that making the world better is a good idea. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has issues though.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mills says that everyone would rather be a sad man than a happy pig, and while I agree with him that being a person is better, I disagree with both the way he's set up the argument and the conclusion.<br>
                Mills argues that nobody smart would rather be ignorant, and that it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied. However, there are several people in this class that would rather be a pig satisfied, so I have to doubt how much Mills really field-tested this one before claiming it to be true. I'd like to clarify his analogy.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main issue is one of agency. An animal can experience a narrower range of pleasure/pain, which means that although they have less capacity to experience pain, they also have less capacity to experience pleasure as well, and a lower ability to control their level of pain/pleasure over time. As a human, you have a greater ability to experience pain, but also greater possible pleasures, and greater control over what pleasure you experience over time. Given this then, it would make sense that everyone would choose to be a human.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other main problem with utilitarianism is that it's more of a framework for arguing from than it is a framework that can tell you what to do on its own. For example, let's say you wanted to construct a building, but the construction of that building would kill 10 million ants. Is it worth it? I mean, you could theoretically weigh the suffering a single ant experiences, multiply it by 10 million, and then compare it to the utility that the people in the building will get out of it, but nobody does that. Instead we just sort of round ant suffering out of the equation.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilitarianism can't tell you what the values you're measuring are, which I think is its main flaw. Other than that, it's a pretty cool method of analysis.
