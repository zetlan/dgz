                <span class="dgn">If you had to explain the problem to an alien, how would it go?</span><br>
                Well, it would probably go something like this:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my gosh an alien! I didn't think those existed!<br>
                <br>
                And then it would go something like this:<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are a mess of chemicals sloshing around in a soup, and for the most part, the brain controls the contents of the soup. Some chemicals make people feel stressed or calm, some chemicals make people feel happy or sad, and the things people consume can influence those chemicals to an extent. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manipulating the chemical makeup of the body is a common practice with a wide range of applications, ranging from helping people wake up in the morning (that's a whole thing to explain, because aliens might not sleep.) to helping people fall asleep in the evening. I am aware that I make it sound like sleeping is difficult, although it's not for most people, and that I am skipping over a lot. But it's ok. because you're not a real alien, you're a hypothetical alien.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some substances can make a person feel happy, or otherwise manipulate a person's emotional state in a way they might want to experience. So they continue to use the chemical. The brain tries to balance out chemical imbalances, so over time a person who uses a lot of a chemical will get used to it, and will have to use more of it to experience the same effect. As well as this, when the body gets used to a chemical, going without it may incur negative side effects. This is what people call an addiction, and is a problem for a number of reasons.<br>
                <br>
                1. Maintaining an addiction is expensive<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oh what's that? You don't have money in your world? Then how do you coerce other aliens into doing things for you?<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would I want to do that? Perhaps we will just have to agree to disagree.<br>
                <br>
                2. many substances alter behavior in negative ways<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when someone has their chemical makeup altered, they may act unpredictably or in ways that they wouldn't normally when they have more control over their body. This can be bad for the people around them, and it can be bad for the person themselves, if they get themselves into a situation they would normally avoid. Having an addiction increases the risk of this happening.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worry I'm missing the purpose of the assignment.
