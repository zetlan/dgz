                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You fool. You absolute fool. You think I'm going to solve problems? I don't solve problems, I simply view them, I experience them, I visualize them. Drug addiction isn't going to be solved. I can't convince someone that they don't hate math. I can't get people to wear masks. I can't find clothes that don't make me feel like a monster. Discord remains blocked on school wifi and nobody seems to care. I contacted the Head of the FCPS IT Department and he said, paraphrased, "yeah sucks for you we aren't changing it." I am a gosh darn fool and I will remain a gosh darn fool into perpetuity.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You absolute buffoon. You come to me? Expecting answers of a satisfactory sort? How dare you? I am insulted. I'm not going to fix anything. I'm not going to change anything. I'm just coasting along, watching as things fall apart.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="dgn">What about a different cultural context?</span><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yeah no it would probably be super easy then
