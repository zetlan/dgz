			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				This is a website catalouging (almost) all the cards for TJ's 1000 Blank White Cards club. <br>
				I did not make the vast majority of cards here. I am merely a navigator.<br>
				I made this because I wanted a database, and although the club had some online cards, it only contained about 1/4th of the total cards in the deck, and didn't feel easy to access.<br>
				The goal is to create an easy system for finding cards that is and stays as complete as possible.<br>
