                Throughout history, there have been many great philosophers. <br>
                I am not one of them. <br>
                However, I do have some things to say, and in my opinion, that counts as philosophy, so I am going to say a bunch of things with fancy words and pretend I'm important, because that's how I feel. <br>
                Let's talk about feelings! They're important. Some people would say that in pursuit of the truth, objectivity should preside over subjectivity, or feelings. Order over chaos, facts over feelings, or whatever. I disagree. I think that, at least in ideology, giving meaning to the world, the subjective is extremely important, and one cannot escape it. <br>
                Since religion sort of.. stopped being a thing everybody does.., there has been a bit of a crisis within humanity. What is one to do with their lives, when the earth is not special and we're all going to die anyways? Many different attempts have been made to remedy the situation, and they pretty much all involve a system of morality. After all, if the scripture does not say what one should do with their lives, how are we to know? <br>
                This section will outline some of the many rules it is possible to use for meaning.<br>
                <br>
                In each document, I would like to start with a quick definition of the main term I'm using, before using that as a jumping-off point to talk about the world. These may not be the rigorous definitions real philosophers use, but this is how I'll be using the words. <br>
