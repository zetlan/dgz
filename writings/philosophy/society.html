                "there's no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look after themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then, also, to look after our neighbours."<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Margaret Thatcher, 1987<br>
                <br>
                Honestly, what even is a society? Can I put it in a box? <b>Can you stack your society?</b><br>
                These are important questions.<br>
                First, we should get a definition of society. Society, to me, is what happens when a bunch of people come together and form a group with shared values. It is a process, not an actual tangible thing, like consciousness. <br>
                    One cannot have a society without lots of people. A society with only one person is just a person, perhaps holding themselves to some moral standard, but still it's just a person. "society" largely doesn't say a lot about the values of the people in it, but I think it does say something, and I'll come back to that later.<br>
                <br>
                I included that quote from Margaret Thatcher because it reflects a view a lot of people have about society. She, in that quote, is talking about how people blame a lot of their problems on society, and really everyone should just be the change they want to see in the world, set your house in order, clean your room, and look after yourself. Blaming society only causes problems.<br>
                <br>
                    However.<br>
                <br>
                That view of problems I feel limits the scope of what we can do. People like Margaret Thatcher want people to improve themselves, set their lives in order, etc, but as soon as that involves changing the world, it's a problem? I don't disagree with cleaning your room; one's external circumstances have a lot to do with one's internal mental state.<br>
                <br>
                For example, if one lives in a garbage apartment, there are many ways to clean that room. They could move out of the apartment, they could become a part of the apartment management system, they could do a lot of things, and one of the things they could do is try to make stricter building codes, so that apartments like that one aren't so bad for everyone else. This counts as cleaning your room, but it also changes society for the better. And I personally think that if you live in a garbage apartment, it's not really your fault.<br>
