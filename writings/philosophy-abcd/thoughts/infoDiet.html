                Where do I get my information?<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youtube<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Washington Post<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my friends<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my family<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discord servers I'm in<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reddit servers I follow<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twitter, but generally only if I'm linked to twitter via another source<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. what is your reality?<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reality is a lot of things, I am a TJ student, I go to school for the vast majority of the day and am usually very tired by the time I get home. I'm currently struggling to do all the school-work on top of extra-curricular activities and trying to be a person. I feel like a coward, and a little lonely, because I desperately want things to change but do not know how to affect change in myself or the world. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like a little ghost. A few months ago, the school closed the lecture hall stairwell. In response, signs were put up over the original signs. Some of them were quite funny, but in the end nothing happened. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks ago, FCPS blocked discord from the school wifi. I decided I was going to do something about it, so I drafted an email to the assistant principal, and got no response. I then went to the IT person, and he said he would contact the district about it, but it's been two weeks and I haven't gotten a response. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every once in a while I have an argument about gender with people who don't understand gender, sometimes with my family or extended family, and the argument is always 45 minutes long at a minimum. Nothing ever gets done. I argue about politics, I argue about what I think is right, I argue and I never convince anyone, except the people who already agree with me. My words are useless in affecting change.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have watched as my body has done weird and wacky things beyond my control, and even weirder things I worry that I have a level of control over but am unable to use effectively. My voice sounds like murder. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have learned, gradually, that I cannot change things, so what is the point in trying? Pretending I don't care gives me power, because people can't hurt me <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this came off unhinged and depressive but I'm not changing it, mostly just to spite Deleuze. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. what would have to happen for you to be pulled out of the cave?<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Socially, most likely not a lot. My life feels like a false stability, I desparately want to escape, to go somewhere, but the daily routine of school, extracurricular activities, and school-work binds my life together. So most likely, one of those things stops happening. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politically, quite a lot. I form my beliefs mostly based off of exclusion of all other possible beliefs. I can't be on the right because they show open disdain for a lot of groups I care about, I can't be authoritarian because I enjoy being free, I can't be a centrist because the world feels unstable and I can't afford not to care about things.<br>
                This sounds depressive because describing the cave is depressive, not because I am depressed.
