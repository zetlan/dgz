			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				This is a website catalouging (almost) all the cards for TJ's 1000 Blank White Cards club. <br>
				I did not make the vast majority of cards here. I am merely a navigator.<br>
				I made this because I wanted a database, and although the club had some online cards, it only contained about 1/4th of the total cards in the deck, and didn't feel easy to access.<br>
				The goal is to create an easy system for finding cards that is and stays as complete as possible.<br> 
			</p>

			<h1>Author Policy</h1>
			<p>
				There are hundreds of cards here, made over the span of quite a few years. Every one of them was made by a person, but I don't know the names of all these people. As such, many of these cards display their author as unknown.<br>
				This does not mean nobody knows who the author was. It just means that the author isn't in the database.<br>
				If you see a card with a missing author, or an author that is incorrect, please contact me! I will update it when possible.<br>
