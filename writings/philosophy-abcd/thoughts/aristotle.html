                Aristotelian ethics says that to be ethical, you should do what aligns with virtues, where virtues are broadly defined as being good.<br>
                <br>
                He says that to figure out what to do in a situation, you should call on both your past experiences and the advice of a good person. For example, if you're trying to figure out whether to go to volleyball practice or to visit your mother who is suddenly in the hospital, while Kant would say that you should never break a promise and should go to the volleyball practice, Aristotle says that you should call upon your experiences, ask other people (who will most likely say that your mother is more important) and then go visit her, because a good person would go visit their mother when she is in the hospital.<br>
                <br>
                The Aristotelian system of ethics is certainly interesting, and at face value seems to solve some problems with the other systems of ethics. However, I think it actually creates more problems than it solves.<br>
                <br>
                For the sake of completeness, these are the 4 virtues I found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_ethics#Four_Cardinal_Virtues">wikipedia</a>. - Prudence (Wisdom), Temperance, Courage, and Justice. Cool.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite having this set of virtues, they manage to not really say anything about what a person should do. Let's take the idea of causing a revolution.<br>
                Is it in line with temperance to initiate a revolution? Common sense says no, but if the government is horrible enough, overthrowing it and starting a new one could be considered more moderate than what the government will do if it continues. Have good people started revolutions? Well, George Washington led one, and he's a good person. But Martin Luther King was staunchly anti-violence, and by extension anti-revolution, and he was a good person as well. The ethics of good people will inherently conflict, because lots of different people can both be good and have extremely different ideas about the world.<br>
                <br>
                Not saying anything specific about the world is an issue, yes, but I think the more pronounced issue with this ethical system is how it requires the world to be. If you get your morality from good people, there's no room to question systems in place, making virtue ethics inherently conservative.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all your elders are racist and don't think you should date / make friends with a person of a different race, then virtue ethics says that they're correct, because they're good people overall. But. No. Good people are capable of having bad opinions, and even deciding who's a good person presupposes things about the world, making this system essentially all feelings and very little actual analysis, in my opinion. Where are the logical arguments in this system? Because you can have logical arguments with utilitarianism, easily, by arguing over which options cause more harm. To an extent, you can also have logical arguments with Kantian ethics, by arguing over which maxims are broken / what the maxims should be. I don't see how that can happen with Utilitarian ethics, without both sides just citing examples of good people, or just saying their feelings about what's right to each other very loudly. <br>
                <br>
                Despite all the other flaws in this system, I think there is some truth to the idea of faking it until you become it. That process doesn't work with everything, I don't think it works all of the time either. For some good examples see gay people - they fake a sexuality from the moment of their birth and never really become it. If "fake it until you become it" worked, then there wouldn't be gay people. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for smaller things that are more mindset based, it makes sense. A lot of chess players quit because they think they aren't good enough, when in reality they're better than most people. The advice of faking it until you become it would cause the chess player to play more games, and eventually improve, wherein they become a better chess player.<br>
