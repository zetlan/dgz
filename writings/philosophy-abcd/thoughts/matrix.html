                <br>
                One of the major ways to read it is as a trans allegory, which in my opinion, works. Some people don't like it as a reading of the film, but I think reading it that way adds to the value the movie has. Near the beginning of the film Neo is sent a message telling him he's been leading two lives, and there's talk of something off about the world that you can't place. This is similar to how a lot of trans people experience the world, with the concept of themselves as their birth gender and as their preferred gender often conflicting.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trinity mentions that "you hardly sleep, you live alone, and night after night, you sit by your computer,". In the modern age, isolation and escape to the internet are common ways trans people deal with existing in a space that's otherwise hostile towards them. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a line near the middle of the movie, where neo says "I have all these memories and none of them happened." This also fits extremely well into the trans narrative; a common experience is having their memories as their birth gender clash with their current selves, because the context of remembering them is vastly different. In fact, a prominent trans youtuber, contrapoints, made this exact point in one of her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyaftqCORT4&t=606s">videos.</a> (I am aware this is also probably not the best source to cite academically but hey, it's culture. Maybe don't open this video up around your children, there are swears.)<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criticisms of this read will say that the creators of the movie weren't trans when they made the movie, or that it's just not obvious. To the just not seeing it point, I am not sure what to say. You're free to dismiss a reading of the work, but I personally think the gender reading has too many bits of the movie line up to discredit entirely. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the movie creator point, I actually agree with this one. I don't think it's a reason to discount the reading of the movie, but I don't think the opinions of the movie creators have any influence over how the movie should be read. They can possibly help explain some of the decisions made, but in the end, the way a movie is read isn't up to the creators, because they put the media into the world for other people to consume and interpret. If a good percentage of people read media a way that's different from what the author intended, they're not wrong. They believe what they believe because the author was vague enough that their interpretation was able to exist. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is getting a little lost. I don't want to spend too much time harping on this point, especially when I'm not actually arguing against someone.<br>

                <span class="dgn">Agent Smith</span><br>
                His eyes change color. I don't understand why. But I am relatively sure they change between blue and brown at least a few times in the movie. <br>
                His monologue is also interesting.<br>
                <br>
                "I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure."<br>
                <br>
                Alright. There's a lot to unpack here.<br>
                <br>
                "Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not."<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an interesting argument. Unfortunately, it's false. Human population has been growing for a long time, but the growth rate is decreasing, and looking at patterns from developed countries shows that the population reaches a carrying capacity. <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog30/book/export/html/205#:~:text=The%20model%20has%20four%20stages,keeping%20the%20population%20relatively%20level">This</a> (don't worry this one is a website, not a video, if you want a video explanation view <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0">this</a> instead) explains it pretty well, but the basic idea is that people have lots of children when the death rate is high, and tend to have fewer children as the death rate is lowered, access to contraceptives and standard of living increases, etc. Humans were increasing exponentially because we changed our environment to be able to support more humans, but eventually there will be a natural equilibrium.<br>
                <br>
                "You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area."<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source? Because what I see is humans doing a pretty good job of not consuming every single natural resource. Yes, we are pulling fossil fuels out of the ground at an alarming rate, and there's a lot of things we do wrong, but we also generate solar power, and wind power. When we messed up the environment in the 1920s, creating the dust bowl, we changed our farming practices to be more sustainable, and the environment recovered. When we realized we were putting a hole in the ozone layer, we banned the use of substances that depleted the ozone layer. We don't survive by moving to another area, we survive by using our brains. <br>
                <br>
                "There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus."<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, interestingly, not true. Even viruses attempt to live in harmony with their enviornment. The only reason they overconsume is because humans are not the intended enviornment, so they accidentally harm the host.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If agent smith wanted to make the case that humans are a virus, he could have. They must live on a larger organism (the earth as a whole), and they often produce unpleasant outcomes by trying to exploit their environment. However, the key issue is that humans are about as much of a virus as dolphins or spiders are.<br>
