                Kant. Kant kant kant. What am I even supposed to say?<br>
                <br>
                Kant thinks he's being objective; that the rules he comes up, even if not being perfect, can be refined into optimal rules that are good for all of humanity. But his method of doing this, the Categorical Imperative, is just bad. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with, the CI is based off of community values, which can change over time, and while values like "don't murder people" are pretty free and universal, laws like "slavery is bad" or valuing individual liberty are quite a bit less universal. Two different cultures could come to different conclusions on these issues, and both of them could be following the categorical imperative. So it can't be objective.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of slavery. A perfect example of how flawed the categorical imperative is.<br>
                Kant supported slavery, because he thought that slaves weren't people. (I've been told.) So we can see how the categorical imperative can be used. While I could go "if everyone was a slave society would be horrible" and dismiss slavery, Kant goes "if everyone had slaves society would be cool actually, nothing wrong here" and because slaves aren't people, it's just as morally fine as owning cattle or spoons. Unless slavery is actually objectively good, the Categorical Imperative has failed in its goal of finding objective morality. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kant, he dares call himself a moral philosopher when he doesn't question the underlying assumptions of the institutions he lives through. Why do we praise him when seemingly his only virtue was being louder and more obnoxiously persistent than everyone else? It's very frustrating to me.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you, Mr. Field, you frustrate me, because you seem to be unable to answer my questions about Kant's flaws despite supporting Kant. I don't understand you. Do you just like the aesthetic of rationality? Do you just like being able to justify the things you do? Your ideology seems ridiculous to me, and my frustrations are more pronounced when you say things like "Boomers tend to me more utilitarian but zoomers tend to be more Kantian," Ok??? Sure. Fine. Whatever. You win, think what you want to think. You don't need a source, because you're the teacher. You can just make up whatever you want and we'll move past it, continuing onwards towards nothing, because you just get to.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we've learned more about Kant, I've gradually gotten the feeling that Kant is just someone who likes to feel correct. While everyone else is trying to figure out solutions, Kant is over in a corner smirking to himself because he's got it all figured out, because he's the rational one, with the flawless Categorical Imperative, because he's the only one who actually thinks in a world full of sheep. From this angle, everything makes sense. Kant doesn't care about slavery because it's just not on his radar. He doesn't actually care about being logically consistent, he just likes to think he's more consistent than everyone else.<br>
