var chapters_1 = `Josh grumbles at nothing in particular as our spacecraft flies through the void. He's always frustrated at something, whether it's me, the other members of the team (Cynthia and Rob), or the world in general. Finally he says something. "Why are we on this stupid ship?". I sigh. We've been over this a million times, and yet he still insists on attempting to drag us back down to the planet. "I told you", I respond, "We weren't happy on the planet. Leaving was the only way to survive." "Well, maybe you all should have just smiled and dealt with it! Maybe, Bobby, instead of coming up with smart retorts, you should take inspiration from Teardrop!"<br>
<br>
So we sit in silence as the craft ascends further away from the planet's surface, and eventually turns parallel to it. The craft is relatively spacious, with living quarters for all of us connected to a central room where we can chat or just stare out the high quality windows. I think they're some sort of specialized glass, because they've never cracked or broken, although I always worry that they might. I don't completely understand the furniture on the ship. I've never counted it, but there always seems to be just quite not enough furniture to go around. As a result, Rob is sitting on the floor. He reminds us to drink water, and I remind him that we left all our water on the planet.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that was not a good idea.<br>
<br>
I'm still thinking when Josh cuts in again. "We should have at least brought water on this stupid trip. Seriously, we could have just stayed on the planet. Cynthia's the only one dragging us up here." As if on cue, Cynthia walks in. "Hi," she says, like someone who doesn't know how to speak. I certainly don't know how to speak either.<br>

Josh leaves. Rob is still sitting on the floor, even though there are now enough chairs for all three of us to sit in, most likely because`;




var chapters_2 = `How can a NOT gate do its work? For when the power is on, it is easy to simply divert the flow of power. Shutting down a communications line takes no more than the press of a button, and anyone who has witnessed a lightning strike first hand knows that electricity is more than capable of destroying the results of itself. The laws of thermodynamics state that in a closed system, entropy must eventually increase. Entropy, being the lack of information in a system. When a cup of coffee is uniformly distributed, the horrible liquid in perfect harmony with itself, there is only one way to describe the coffee. Writers may disagree, but writers are stupid. <br><br>
I conducted a survey yesterday, in which I went around to all my friends asking about the status of writers. Horribly underpaid, in my opinion, however all of my compatriots aquiesced among themselves that writers are in fact at the very lower end of the hierarchy of respectable jobs! After all, no writers have ever remained friends with over two people. This is why the conversities we had were extremely brief.  <br><br>
Returning to the initial concept at hand, entropy must always increase. In the perfectly balanced cup of coffee, when a human drinks it, they are drinking pure coffee. And the disappointment of the taste is pure as well. However. When one produces from within the premises of their own saline kitchen, a frothy cappuccino, well then the possibilities are endless! Cappucinos not only taste a thousand times more invigorating than plain coffee, but there are ingredianents mixed in as well! The foam, swirling like ten thousand tiny galaxies, dances across the surface of the liquid. The amount of information contained in a single cup of cappuccino is immeasurable. <br><br>
Now. Is this to condemn the likes of the coffee in favor of drinking hot chocolate, where marshmallows melt and change state, a chaotic undercurrent is contained within the container? Or Cappuccino, where the taste is pleasing to the tongue and the soul of a little girl? Partially yes. However. It is more. <br><br>
When a NOT gate receives no power, it faces a dilemma. For how is one to produce from a state of nothing? NOT gates receive one input, and one input alone. They send one output, and one output alone. How can one induce a current when one receives no current? For producing energy would break the very laws of thermodynamics that appear to govern our universe? Why then, must we be subject to the ever-changing cost of a kilowatt, when a NOT gate could produce current all on it's own? It's baffling, the will of the people silenced by a single gate, so tiny it could fit under someone's fingernail. And yet, here we are. At a crossroads, with one side having eternal bliss, and one side containing only suffering. Hell hath its layers like an onion, says Dante, but in reality, hell is the simple NOT gate, generating its power when none is supplied to it. <br><br>
Why must we separate our gates into binaries? Why must a NOT gate return a 1 when it is given a 0? Did we ever stop to consider the impacts that we may be having on the world, and by extension, the NOT gate? Of course not. it would be silly. However.<br><br>  
<br>
However. <br>
<br>
It has been nine hours and forty-five minutes since the last time I spoke to a NOT gate. They were a nice fellow, although technically, if you look closely, they are more complicated than just outputting a 1 when given a 0. The life of the NOT gate is a complex process, fully open to the whims of the electrons whizzing past on an ionizing wind. If you get to know them better, their lives become much more complex, and I am glad I could learn from them.<br>
<br>
I must go. The cappuccino calls.`;





var chapters_3 = `<img src="image/pathUnknown123abc123abc123abc.png" alt="ERROR:images/pathUnknown/123abc123abc123abc.png/file_not_found"> The table wasteland is a most interesting location on the planet. Nobody really remembers how it came to be, but it is certainly a place that exists now, and few can live there. Legend has it that somewhere near the center of the table wasteland, an old carpenter sits, creating tables. However, others say that this is nonsense. <br>
<br>
The table wasteland is 47 miles in radius, and is located at approximately 45° above the equator. Why. The concept of assigning points to different geometries has always eluded me. On a euclidean plane, it is easy. One can assign each point to 2 numbers, one for the x axis, and one for the y axis. One can then use this system to assign coordinates, and they work when added, subtracted, multiplied, or otherwise operated on in most ways. <br>
<br>
On a spherical geometry, the process is similar. For when attempting to map the location of the table wasteland, it is easy to assign those 2 numbers not to points, but instead to angles, spun around perpendicular axes. Only 2 angles can describe any point on the surface of a sphere, and the concept is relatively easy to imagine in the world we live in. After all, humanity live on the surface of a sphere, so most of them are used to the concept.<br>
<br>
However, how can one assign a coordinate system to a hyperbolic plane? Lines curve. Trying to map the surface with squares and then projecting it down to a surface that is easily understandable fails when the coordinate system is ill-defined. I want to assign parallels, but there are too many parallel lines to choose just one. Traveling 180 degrees only sometimes lands a body where it started, and straight lines become arcs of a great circle, perpendicular to infinity. A hyperbolic world is a terrifying one, and this is the where the table wasteland lies. Too many tables are squished onto this tiny speck. More and more tables appear closer to the edges, until the great mass piles up, extruding into dimensions previously unknown. The carpenter has nary the time to fill the space around him<br>
<br>
<br>
the table wasteland has a climate mostly defined by its ever present clouds and blustering wind. The wind always carries the clouds away from the area before they rain, meaning that although the average temperature is not particularly hot, the air is also extremely dry. Fires are occasionally an issue. The last fire was 273 years ago, and burned through 73% of the wasteland before it extinguished itself. It is unknown how the carpenter has maintained their own health through the centuries.<br> `;




var chapters_4 = `Cynthia walks over to me from the chair she is sitting in. "Well, what is there left to say?" She queries. I sigh, unsure of how to articulate my thoughts.<br>
<br>
"I mean yes, I suppose we did work things out between ourselves, but there's still constant tension," I think of how Josh always gets in the way of a productive discussion, how Rob is unhelpful. Us two are really the only ones trying to push forwards, and that's kind of scary. "What if we don't survive?" I ask back. There's the constant threat of extinction, from space or from the many worlds around us.<br>
<br>
Bobby is stubborn. That's one of his many character flaws. "Well, then that's too bad for us I guess. But it's no reason not to try." He scowls at me. I don't understand why he can't just accept us and pilot the gosh darn ship. It's always like this. I know he's not trying to hold us back, but every day counts in the constantly changing universe. "That's scary though, this is our entire universe we're talking about. We can't just accept a universe without us in it."<br>
<br>
I think about the proposition. "Yes we can. And anyways, it's not like the universe can really just snuff us out as easily as that."<br>
<br>
I am confused. Cynthia's saying a lot of things that don't make sense. Of course the universe can just snuff us out, like the lives of so many of our compatriots. I voice these concerns, and she laughs. "None of those were really the universe's fault. It was all internal conflicts that eventually lead to their... departure." I have an easy counter-argument for that. "Well, won't going through with this plan involve internal conflicts?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, but that's a different type of internal conflict, the type where we learn and grow and become better people." <br>
<br>
We are both unhappy at this discussion.<br>
<br>
I stare out the window at the purple planet below, the occasional patch of orange catching my eye as bits of debris skate across the upper atmosphere. We have been orbiting the planet for quite a long time. It's only been a few weeks, but it feels like forever, since we keep having the same conversations over and over again. Are there other things to talk about? Of course. But for some reason, we keep coming back to this topic. <br>

var chapters_6 = `A metaphor is commonly used by writers to add vibrance and passion to writing, or to make a part easier to understand. For example, how could one describe the creator of the universe without metaphors? They have been described as so many different things, one begins to wonder how we could possibly not describe them. What if instead of using a metaphor properly, one were to take a metaphor and stretch it across the entirety of a body of work, not connecting it to any story at all until the very end? Would that be productive at all? Perhaps, but it would also not make for a very compelling story. After all, if we cannot care about the characters, and they are only metaphors, then what is the purpose of the story? <br>
<br>
24 hour time is better than 12 hour time. Why? Because it's more descriptive and requires fewer characters. I can describe all times of the day with 24 hour time in 5 characters (from 00:00 to 23:59) but with 12 hours, not only are there repeat times, but you have to add an extra three characters to the end. (12:00 to 11:59 AM and 12:00 to 11:59 PM.) Not only that, but the 12s always get confused, and require context around them to really internalize what time it is. If I were to say "I ate lunch at 12:37," the reader would assume that the 12 in question is noon, and not midnight. However, if the sentence was "I ate a snack at 12:37," then the context is simply not enough to determine what time the writer is truly talking about, and therefore the AM or PM must be added to the end.<br>
<br>
Also clocks! Don't get me started on the clocks. All the analog clocks are 12 hour clocks. WHY? Who decided that 12 hour time was the best way to measure the time, as if going around the face 2 times a day instead of 1 isn't enough. Alex over here was has to clean the dishes at 2:00, but because of the 12 hour clocks, they clean them twice a day instead of the required once. How are they supposed to know at what time the dishes should be cleaned? Because the clock sure doesn't! I'm really out here watching people clean the dishes twice a day.<br>`;

    -Nicholas of Cuza, 1450.<br>
<br>
<br>    
What. <br>
<br>
What?<br>
<br>
I am sitting alone in my room, thinking about appearences. To what extent is my appearence my own? I am confused. When I am online, I play a character. There are certain important differences between me and my online persona that make it pertinent to know the differences. For one, the names are different. Clementine is not my real last name. There are many things I do in real life, such as cubing, that I do not express online.<br>
<br>
However, in a sense, do I not also play a character in real life? My desk is a mess, as it always is. My mother keeps saying I should clean it, but I don't really feel like it, because I would probably get distracted and also it's not that exciting to clean a desk off. My mother and her husband are working on the bathroom remodelling, and they are making quite a lot of noise. I've never really liked it when they remodel parts of the house. I'm not really sure why though, perhaps that is another topic for introspection on.<br>
<br>
My point is that there are parts of my life that I don't express when going out into the world. I don't tell strangers/friends my life story, sometimes even if they ask. I sometimes wonder how much of me really exists, or if it's all a combination of characters I have created over the years. For example, I stopped cubing a few months ago, after an... event with one of my friends, who also cubes. My online persona never cubed, and so the event had absolutely no impact. I stopped cubing in real life, meaning the character people see me as stopped cubing as well. However, to a few of my family members, the character of me still cubes, and is still improving, because the version of me that they have is outdated and wrong. <br>
<br>
A lot of these little things are ok, tiny divergences from my true self, but if my true self diverges greatly from the person I am to the people around me, then there starts to be a problem. I start to wonder if maybe there is no true self, just layers of characters performing actions.<br>
<br>
This is not helpful. If I have no true self, then it doesn't make sense that without the influences of society, I enjoy certain things and do not enjoy others.<br>
<br>
My carpet is pretty soft, and the constant whirr of the fans of my laptop is comforting, even though there are other grinding, crashing, and unpleasant sounds that pervade the air in my room. I attempt to not focus on them, in failure. Disappointed, I call up one of my friends to talk to him. "Hey Bobby, how are you?" He responds.<br>
