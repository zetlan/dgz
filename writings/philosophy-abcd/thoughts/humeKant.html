                There are a few ideas in our discussion of Hume and Kant that make sense, and I think are useful. For example, both of them agree that we recieve information through our senses. Although Hume and Kant disagree about causality (Hume thinks that the brain produces causality, while Kant thinks that causality exists and we observe it), they both agree that we must observe things and filter them through our brain.<br>
                <br>
                The chart, with A Priori vs Posteriori and Analytic vs Synthetic is the weird bit. Hume claims that there are only types of information that are definitionally true and don't require experience, and things that are constructed and do require experience. This seems... weird to me.<br>
                Strangely, the part of this that Kant disputed was the A priori Synthetic section, where he claimed that math and science went. He thought that Hume would destroy science by making every scientific discovery subjective, as it went in the synthetic posteriori section, so to solve this problem, he made science not require experience but still be non-definitional.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a leap that I'm not comfortable with. I can perhaps understand the argument for putting some scientific discoveries in this third quadrant, but math? Really? 2 + 2 = 4, at the end of the day, is a definition. It's a thing we just made up. It is true, that if you take two apples and set another two apples next to them, you will have 4 apples in the same area, but we as humans made up what 2, 4, and adding mean. We defined these things into existence, so they should go in the definitional category. In fact, all of our mathematical constructs, and even a lot of science, works this way. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take physics for example. Fg = GmM / r^2 is one of our equations for the force of gravity. And while that is a *new* construct, it's not created from whole cloth. Scientists came up with it by looking at a bunch of planetary orbits, and then tying heavy spheres to some string and looking at that, and it's all just definitional. The only new thing that we've gained are definitions, which we can then use to manipulate conditions in a way that we want.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing. I can't help but notice that a common theme of philosophers is coming up with stupid, specific, context-free definitions for terms everyone already uses. I imagine the reason for this is they just want to provoke people into questioning them, which allows them to explain their ideas which are so wonderful. This has happened with such words as "reason", "free", "real", and so on. And now Hume's done it again with the word "new". Yes Hume, you're so clever. If you define new to mean completely original, without any previous experiences guiding it, then yes. It is impossible to create something new. But I can't imagine a situation in which you would use this definition, because a definition of "new" that defines out of existence anything that could be considered new is beyond useless. It is a hindrance to conversation, because it doesn't allow me to talk about my new bike (it's constructed based off of previous bikes) or someone's new painting (it was based off of their experiences and ideas) or a new idea (the idea of redefining New.)<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third problem I have with this is the second unused quadrant - Posteriori Analytic, which essentially are definitions that require experience. I would argue that actually, all definitions should be moved into this quadrant. Here's an example - Do you know what pickled vegetables taste like? You're an adult, so probably you do, but imagine you don't for a moment. It would be very difficult to fully describe the taste to people, and you might even say you just have to try it. It's the same thing with a lot of foods; taste descriptions are ok, but you really don't get the full definition of "pickled carrot flavor" until you actually consume a pickled carrot. It requires experience. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can define what a chair is, (my favorite,) but the definition will be almost worthless to someone who hasn't been around chairs for a significant period of time, or who doesn't ever need to sit down, because it's simply not possible to capture everything in a definition. Are horses chairs? Are bent trees chairs? The answer is that it depends if you're a horseback rider or if you're a child hanging out with their friend on a summer afternoon. All of our definitions are attempts to codify into words our own experiences, and without the experiences they are empty shells of their meaning. So both Hume and Kant are wrong.
