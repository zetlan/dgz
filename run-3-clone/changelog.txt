V1.14 - November-6-2021
    Added sections to the A tunnel so that it lines up with the L-tunnel (canonically it does that anyways, but player_03 does his dumb distance-stretching thing so I had to change things)
    bug fixes:
        entering backwards levels is now more consistient
        exiting out of a cutscene into challenge mode no longer makes the camera wacky
        exiting out of a cutscene no longer allows you to play as locked characters
        there is no longer a phantom child in the cutscene "You Think"

    quality-of-life:
        holding escape for 5 seconds will now trigger a soft reset of the game, hopefully fixing crashes while keeping all data intact
        holding alt while moving the camera in cutscene edit mode will now slowly pan it
        improved audio of Unsafe Speeds and Wormhole to Somewhere
        you now have the option to halve the framerate of gameplay
        tunnels you have walked by but not entered now show up on the map
        A-tunnel now connects to L tunnel, as it should have in the first place

    misc development:
        cutscene coordinates can now be relative to a tunnel. This makes it easier to move tunnels around (no longer have to re-do the entire cutscene)
        improved readability in placing of cutscenes
