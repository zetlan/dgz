                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death penalty for all drug users. Would this solve the problem? No, it actually most likely wouldn't. First of all, killing everyone who used drugs would be impractical, it would be very difficult. Second of all, the state would spend billions on lawyers to prosecute and make 100% sure that every drug user really was a drug user, and not just someone who ate too many poppy seed bagels or something. The current death penalty costs millions per person, why would anyone spend that on a cause that won't solve the issue anyways? You kill all the drug users, then what? There will be more drug users. <br>

                How could you use mischief to disrupt the situation?<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just sell drugs to everyone. Could be a cool fundraiser event. The state could hand out heroin. Spicy.<br>
                <br>
                What if we broke some stuff?<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then some stuff would be broken. Next question please.<br>
                <br>
                How might someone evil exploit you?<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well they would start by becoming friends with me, we would go out into the park together, I would pack a picnic lunch, and we would sit under the night sky, illuminated only by the stars. A stream may be rushing in the background.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would go canoeing, and then stop because I don't actually like canoeing. And then after that, would come the betrayal. Slowly, the evil person would start doing evil things, they would argue with me over things that I care deeply about, forcing me to argue back. We would have the same conversations over and over again, tiring me out until I went to bed one day 30 years later, realizing the worst thing of all; they've disrupted my relationship with my father, and for the short-term monetary benefit I hath traded a deep personal connection that I may never get back. I stare out at the sunset longing for days past.<br>
