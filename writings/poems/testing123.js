I'm scared of monsters.<br>
Monsters that abduct children, that steal dreams, that hide in the shadows.<br>
Monsters that are overly tall, with cracking joints,<br>
and monsters that whisper sweet outrages, that ask for matches, that dress themselves.<br>
I'm scared of monsters that call for unity, and choose to slice populations <br>
because in the end, I am a simple coward, but they aren't afraid to wield power. <br>

Abigail, Ellie, Stephanie, I look at them and I feel.. disgust.<br>
How sad, how poetic, that I spend my days decrying those who oppose them and yet ultimately, I am the same? <br>
A tangled ball of nightmares and invalidity, like a million insects crawling over my skin. It's horrible. <br>
It's me.<br>
`

var poems_fooled = `
Did I do it? Did I fool you? Did you manage to think these were actual poems? No, no you absolute fool. This was about me the whole time. <br>
A withering tangle of narcissism, how dare you think your thoughts are important enough to put on a website? You absolute limp-wristed piece of cutlery. You think other people want to read what's going on in that messed up head of yours? <br>
You think you aren't going to face consequences for this?<br>
<br>
In the end, it's still all about me. I'm the narrator, I'm the critic, I'm the coward <strong>and</strong> the knight in shining armor, wielding a keyboard and the power of creation. And with that, I carve out a tiny trash can in the corner of the universe.<br>
Pathetic.`;

var poems_vague = `
I sometimes wonder if being intentionally vague is problematic. Not just in the instance of using it as a crutch too much, but <br>
well yeah that part is rather important, but like<br>
wouldn't it be better to say something specific for once? Instead of talking medieval metaphors, actually say something true? Something honest, that's not hidden and poisoned by the need to convey strength?<br>
<br>
<br>
It's currently spring. It's going to be summer soon, and that means warmer weather, which in turn means shorts and t-shirts, instead of more covering clothing. <br>
This year, I have been tasked with buying my own clothing, which to anyone else would be a great liberty, but to me is a burden. I get to peruse the poorly organized clothing store websites as they try to sell me everything except what I actually want to buy, which is simple shorts that fit me and don't make me hate myself when I wear them.<br>
On the other hand, I could attempt to buy the clothing that I <strong>actually <i>actually</i></strong> want to buy, but that's too real even for this website. I have limitations with a repository that people I am close to can see. Unfortunate.<br>
<br>
I've hit my limit. How to get to the crux of the issue, without veering off into basic teenager territory, and without spiraling into something that could get me a good talking to by my family? It's impossible. So vagueposting it is.

Cement? A-16? Shrey? Is that you?
Not going to lie, it's terrifying not knowing who could be reading this. Y'all could be reading this right now and simply.. decide to not tell me. 
That's fair. I wouldn't tell me either. But still, I suppose I'm sorry. These writings.. do not depict the best sides of me. That's why I don't have them on the main page.
Feel free to ask me any questions, I'll probably be more open about them in discord logs than I am here.
