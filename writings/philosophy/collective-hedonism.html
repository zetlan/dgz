                Collective hedonism is the idea that the goal in life should be to maximize pleasure for everyone. It is similar to hedonism, but more collectivist, so it seemingly solves the second issue. Except there's still a problem. How does one measure pleasure?<br>
                In the current age, we have the power to scan someone's brain and see which sections of the brain have the most activity. From this, we can determine if someone is happy or not. And it seems simple, right? Well, no. It's impossible to tell the difference between whether someone is truly happy, or whether someone has been brainwashed to be happy. They activate the same part of the brain. <br>
                That may seem like science fiction, but religion is similar. (I do not mean that religion brainwashes people, but..) to some Christians, it would make sense to say that everyone should pray to god. After all, it brings them pleasure, and seems to improve their lives. People from other religions would say the same. Many muslim women wear head coverings voluntarily, because it seemingly brings them pleasure. But to some athiests, that's silly. It's coercive to force women to wear head coverings, and women doing it voluntarily must be brainwashed, and don't actually enjoy it. <br>
                That's a dangerous idea, because it gives one person the power to say "I know what's good for you", and the other person cannot refuse. Any excuse the person has for their religion can be shot down with "how do you know?" or "your religion has blinded you," and with an unprovable thing like religion, that's extremely problematic. A more tolerant person may say "alright, they can do it as long as it doesn't hurt me," but that doesn't really fix the original problem, which is that the person saying that doesn't believe it is actually good for the other person. They just think "well that person's deluded, but it's ok." <br>
                This can be applied to a lot of things, and in the end it's all subjective. Is this enough to throw collective hedonism out? <br>
                <br>
                Well, I don't know. It's confusing, because everyone has a slightly different definition of pleasure, and different ideas on how to maximize it. Another problem, what does maximizing even mean? <br>
                Does it mean to take the mean? The median? The mode? Again, one can't even measure happiness in discreet units. Obviously if one person is 'happy' and everyone else in their society is 'unhappy' then it's worse than everyone being happy, but this also says nothing of their material conditions. Someone raised in a wealthy family and someone raised in a poor family would have very different opinions on middle-class housing, and if the goal is just happiness, it could logically make sense to force children into bad conditions so they may have better ones later. <br>
                There are many problems with this ethical system. So too, are there problems with other systems. But personally, I'm going to throw this one out. <br>
