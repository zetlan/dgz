                <span class="dgn">what assumptions have already been made? Could they be wrong, or shifted?</span><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of drug addiction, I generally assume people want to get better, but I know many other people have a more negative view of drug users. I read a youtube comment once (I know, stellar place for political discourse, but hey I get exposed to views I don't like) that said addicts "just wanted another chance to get their happy juice". This, to me, expresses a contempt for the drug addicted, but it's important to take into account and either accept it or combat if I want to solve the problem. <br>

                <span class="dgn">What if the brief is too narrow? Too wide?</span><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I imagine the problem won't get solved, because the brief won't be addressing it.<br>
