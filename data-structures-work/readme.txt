all work in this folder is by me, having the ID J1-30 in this class in 2020-2021. 

I'm working in visual studio code because to be honest I can't bear to work in jGrasp. If I were smarter I would download intelliJ and work in there, but I am lazy and also not that smart, so here I am.

No copying please. If you're a student taking this class and you happen to have found this, do your own work. I do not want to get in trouble, and you probably don't want to get in trouble either. 
I'm not sure how sophisticated their plaigarism checkers are and I don't want to test it.

For everyone else, feel free to read through this. Have fun!
